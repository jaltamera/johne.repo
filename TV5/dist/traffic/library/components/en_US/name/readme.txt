
Description

name.opal is a network that interprets first and last names. Two standard files of common first and last names are 
provided (firstnames.txt and lastnames.txt). It is also possible to explicitly define that a search should be considered 
as a first or last names (for example, "firstname scott").


Integration Notes

This .opal file also reads names from two files (firstNamesSync.txt and lastnamesSync.txt), which can be updated with 
name information obtained as part of data live synchronization, prior to the .opal file being loaded.
